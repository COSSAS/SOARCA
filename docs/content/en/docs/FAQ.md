## General questions 

### Does SOARCA have a GUI?

SOARCA currently does not feature a GUI for tracking the progress on playbook execution. Too edit [CACAO v2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/security-playbooks-v2.0.html) playbooks, consider using the [CACAO Roaster](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/cacao-roaster) project.
