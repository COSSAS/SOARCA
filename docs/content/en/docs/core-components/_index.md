---

SOARCA consists of several key components:

1. **SOARCA Core**: This is the heart of SOARCA, represented in green.
2. **SOARCA Native Capabilities**: These are the functionalities explicitly defined in the Cacao v2 specification and are integral to the core. They are also represented in green.
3. **Fins**: These are the extension capabilities, also known as Fins. They enhance the functionality and integration of SOARCA and are depicted in orange. These are not part of this repository.
