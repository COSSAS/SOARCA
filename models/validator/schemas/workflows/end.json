While this type inherits all of the common properties of a workflow step it does not define any additional properties. When a playbook or branch of a playbook terminates it MUST call an end step. This workflow step MUST NOT use the 'on_completion', 'on_success', or 'on_failure' properties. While an end step MUST exist for the overall workflow, additional end steps MAY be present for workflow branches.",
