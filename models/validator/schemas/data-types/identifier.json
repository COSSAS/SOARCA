    "description": "The identifier data type represents an RFC 4122-compliant UUID [RFC4122] and uses the JSON string type [RFC8259] for serialization. \n\nAn identifier uniquely identifies a CACAO object. All identifiers MUST follow the form object-type--UUID, where object-type is the exact value (all type names are lowercase strings by definition) from the type property of the object being identified and where the UUID MUST be an RFC 4122-compliant UUID [RFC4122]. \n\nThe UUID part of the identifier MUST be unique across all objects regardless of the type identified by the object-type prefix. Meaning, a producer MUST NOT reuse the UUID portion of the identifier for objects of different types. \n\nAll CACAO objects SHOULD use UUIDv4 for the UUID portion of the identifier. A CACAO playbook object MAY use UUIDv5 for the UUID portion of the identifier. All CACAO step objects MUST use UUIDv4. \n\nUsing a UUIDv5 for the playbook MAY allow producers and consumers using the same namespace and contributing properties to generate the same identifier for that playbook. When using UUIDv5 the UUID portion of the UUIDv5-based identifier SHOULD be generated according to the following rules: \n\nThe namespace SHOULD be 'aa7caf3a-d55a-4e9a-b34e-056215fba56a'. \n\nThe value of the name portion SHOULD be a series of properties from the object that will ensure a globally unique identifier and those properties SHOULD be stringified according to the JSON Canonicalization Scheme [RFC8785] to ensure a canonical representation of the JSON data. \n\nThe contributing properties to the playbook object's UUIDv5 name portion SHOULD be the name and playbook_types properties. \n\nProducers not following these rules MUST NOT use a namespace of 'aa7caf3a-d55a-4e9a-b34e-056215fba56a'",
