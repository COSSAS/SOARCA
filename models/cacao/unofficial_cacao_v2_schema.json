The scope of a variable is determined by where the variable is declared. A variable may be defined globally for the entire playbook or locally within a workflow step. Variables are scoped to the object they are defined in, and any object that is used or referenced by that object. A specific variable can only be defined once, however, a variable can be assigned and used in the object where it is defined or in any object used or referenced by that object (e.g., a playbook variable can be assigned at the playbook level but also reassigned a different value within a workflow step). Variables are referenced by using the key name from the dictionary with a suffix (keyword) of ':value'. For example, if you had a variable in the dictionary called '__ip_addresses__', one could reference this and use it in a playbook by using '__ip_addresses__:value'. Variables MAY be passed to and from external playbooks provided that system supports passing of arguments when the system function is invoked or returns its results.",

Targets are stored in a dictionary where the ID is the key and the value is an 'agent-target' object (see section 9.1). Common properties for agents and targets are defined in section 6.1. \n\nAgents can involve either manual or automated processing. For example, an individual may process a command manually, while a firewall may process a command automatically. An agent type vocabulary is defined in section 6.2, and each agent type is further defined in the rest of the sections. Types include security infrastructure such as firewalls, routers, and threat intelligence platforms, as well as specific network addressable agents like URLs and IPv4/IPv6/MAC addresses. \n\nAgents can use and refer to variables just like other parts of the playbook. For any agent property value, the producer may define a variable substitution such that the actual property value is determined at runtime based on the variable assigned to the agent. In Example 6.1,an agent is referenced within a workflow step, but the agent's actual values are based on variables (e.g., name, email, phone, location) instead of being hard-coded by the agent itself.",
